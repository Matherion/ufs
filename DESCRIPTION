Description: This is a new version of the userfriendlyscience package,
    which has grown a bit unwieldy. Like userfriendlyscience, ufs
    contains a number of functions that serve two goals. First, to
    make R more accessible to people migrating from SPSS by adding a
    number of functions that behave roughly like their SPSS equivalents
    (also see <https://rosettastats.com>). Second, to make a number of
    slightly more advanced functions more user friendly to relatively
    novice users. The package also conveniently houses a number of
    additional functions that are intended to increase the quality of
    methodology and statistics in psychology, not by offering technical
    solutions, but by shifting perspectives, for example towards
    reasoning based on sampling distributions as opposed to on
    point estimates.
